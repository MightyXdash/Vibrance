# Vibrance
vibrance is an opensource color grading software. I have made sure the software is very easy to use and has no bloat.

if you are new on GitHub or doen't know how to download-locate the "release(s)" and then press on it and you will find the latest version tagged as latest.
then scroll down to assets and download the .exe file and install it. boom . now you have VIbrance running on your computer.
